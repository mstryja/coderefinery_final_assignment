# Personal Reflection

# Day 1 and 2: 

**Topic:** Introduction to version control
---

Using git is must have in the moder research world. Git providers like GitHub, GitLab or Atlassian make using git more accessible, what gives a great opprotunity for researchers to not only share their work in the paper-style format, but also as already built software packages and ready to use products. Moreover, these providers put a lot of effort on making git discussable - where other people can pointing out mistakes, poor logic or lack of crucial parts. 

Through day 1 and day 2 we explored git and it's basics. In my opinion it was a great opportunity to remind the basics which I have not been using for some time. Day 1 and day 2 was focused on working with git locally and remotely. In my opinion both skills are crucial to fully understand the git.

# Day 3:

**Topic:** Collaborative distributed version control
---

Within this lesson branching, pull requests, merging and git collaboration has been introduced. In my opinion, those concepts are the most important concepts of git. THe idea behind using git is to collaborate with other people and manage large project, where multiple contruibutors are involved. Personally I am working on daily basis using this tools, so for me this lesson was a very nice summary of what is available and what are the best practices.

# Day 4:

Day 4 was focused on introduce fundamentals form reproducible research, social coding and open source.

**Topic:** Reproducible research
---
Reproducible research is a feature of research project, which let others to easily jump into the project and focus directly on providing research values, not solving environmental bugs and guessing 'what author meant'. During this lesson, course providers introduced the idea behind reproducilbe research, power of well prepared README.md file and licensing. Moreover, the policy of software sharing at TU Delft has been introduced. In my opinion, this lesson was very important, as it introduced the idea of reproducible research, which is very important in the research world.

**Topic:** Social coding and open software
---
As part of this lesson, we have been tought how to deal with open software, how to provide repositories which can be used my third party. What are the crucial aspects of open source projects. Authors mentioned about licencisng, software organization, good practice of README.md, which cover all important issues, including links to the papers, documentation of the scientific methods used in the packege and organization of requirements.txt file, where all dependencies versions are listed.

# Day 5:

Day 5 covered two main topics: Documentation and Jupyter notebooks.

**Topic:** Documentation
---
Documentation is one of the most important aspect in any project. During the lesson, authors intorduced tools to generate and prepare documentation, however, in my opinion there was a lack of good practice in preparing documentation. As a reflaction, I can say that through my career experience, I realized how important documentation is, in particular in software projects.

**Topic:** Jupyter Notebooks
---
Jupyter notebooks - python-based tool to perform experiments and create the interactive scripts has been introduced. I am very familiar with jupyter notebooks, mostly due to the fact I am working with them since 2019. In my opinion it was a very good introdution to jupyter and a lot of jupyter-related tools have been introduced. Introduction to good practice in preparing notebooks was missing in my opinion. When working with notebooks, very importnat is to organize cells in the way which let easily conversion to the python script.

# Day 6:

Day 6 was focused on introduction to automated testing and modular code development

**topic:** automated testing
---
Automated testing is a very important aspect of software development. During the lesson, authors introduced the idea of automated testing, and how to perform it using python. In my opinion, this lesson was very important, as it introduced the idea of automated testing, which is very important in the software development world.

**topic:** modular code development
---
Modular code development has been introduced as a way to organize projects. With focus on research projects. With curse authors we had an opportunity to take part in the life coding session, where based on students' suggestions, authors created a good example of modular python script. It was very valuable lesson. What was missing in my opinion, it was the focus on creating subfunctions, decorators and classes, which is the most important aspect of modular code development in python.
