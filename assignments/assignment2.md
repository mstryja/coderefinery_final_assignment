**When should you work with branches?**

Branches are functionality of git, to switch between version control. The true value of using branches can be extracted in a few different scenarios, however the most popular is working on the project, where a few programmers are engaded, and each of them are working on the different functionality. In this case, each of the programmers can work on the different branch, and then merge the changes to the main branch. This way, the main branch is not affected by the changes, and the code is not broken. The other case, when git branches can be used, is when the new functionality is being developed, and the code is not ready to be merged to the main branch. In this case, the new branch can be created, and the code can be pushed to the new branch. This way, the code is not merged to the main branch, and the main branch is not affected by the changes. Finally, in the research-oriented project, branches can be useful to test the new functionality, and then merge the changes to the main branch. This way, the main branch is not affected by the changes, and the code is not broken.

**What is the difference between a git clone and a git fork?**

Git clone is a command, which is used to copy the repository to the local machine. This command is used to create the local copy of the repository, and then work with the code. Git fork is a functionality of git, which is used to create the copy of the repository on the remote server. This functionality is used to create the copy of the repository, and then work with the code. The main difference between git clone and git fork is that git clone is used to create the local copy of the repository, while git fork is used to create the copy of the repository on the remote server.

#### Question 3:

---
**What is the difference between a fork and a branch?**

Git fork is a functionality of git, which is used to create the copy of the repository on the remote server. This functionality is used to create the copy of the repository, and then work with the code. Git branch is a functionality of git, which is used to create the new branch in the repository. This functionality is used to create the new branch, and then work with the code. The main difference between git fork and git branch is that git fork is used to create the copy of the repository on the remote server, while git branch is used to create the new branch in the repository.

#### Question 4:

**What advantages and disadvantages to code review can you imagine/list?**

Code review is a process of reviewing the code, which is performed by the other programmers. Below, the list of advantages of code review is presented:

- Code review reduce a risk of error occurrence
- Code review can increase the readibility of code, by providing the point of view of others programmers, oftenly with more experience
- Code review can pointing out logic bugs - bugs where logic is not exactly as expected by the software architects.

Below, the list of disadvantages of code review is presented:

- Code review increase the complexity of the process, make it slower. 
- Code review can be performed by the programmers, who are not familiar with the code, and can provide the wrong feedback.
- Code review in most cases is not sufficient and for large project can be impossible to effectively perform.
